## Wireframing - The design blueprint

This document contains general notes related to the importance of wireframes in application design. A wireframe is a black and white blueprint that focuses on the structure and layout of a application or website....

<br>

## The Importance of Wireframes
A wireframe is a easy way to visualize the position of page elements and show how features of function. 

* When creating a wireframe keep these principles in mind: __Clarity__, __Confidence__, __Simplicity is key__
* Wireframes can save time in a number of ways 
* A grayscale view of a sites layout with features using  page elements
* A wireframe gives the opportunity to make changes to structure, features, and even a checklist
* A wireframe is NOT a prototype

<br>

## Wireframing Tools
When it comes to creating a Wireframe I search for the "best wireframing tools" or "best wireframe ui kit" and find tons of resources but never found one I can save as a starter file for future projects until now.  

* [Wireframe Template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1406965928251985631/wireframing-template) - Free Wireframe template from Figma
* [Visily](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1406965928251985631/wireframing-template) - Wireframe tool w/ AI assistance
* There are two types of wireframes
 - Low-fidelity are grayscale layouts that use a simple image mock content
 - High-fidelity has more detail and offer more information on page elements and structure

<br>

## Wireframing...AVOID these steps 
A Low-fidelity wireframe keeeps it simple allowing a desinger to focus an the layout.  

* **Adding too much information**: When first starting can distract from the task at hand -- Layout 
* **Unclear content**: Know what content you want to dipslay 
* **Wireframe for each page**: Keep it simple and mobile first
